        <h2>Principals Message</h2>        
        <p>Dear Parents, <br>
          Every day at school we repeeat our motto and theme.<br>
          <b>Our motto is:</b> At DSES we will be Kind, Be Safe and Be Responsible.<br>
          <b>Our them is:</b> You are the "key to Kindness.<br>
          We remind ourselves of this daily. 
           We use tools to show Kindness to our teachers, ourselves, and other 
           students. During Septembere, we worked on our Look and Listen Skills.
        </p>        
        <p>For the month of October, we will learn how to use the tool of 
          "Following Instructions" to show kindness. Following instructions is 
          a skill to use when somneone is giving you directions or requesting
          that you do something. 
        </p>        
        <p>The steps inclue:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Look and Listen</li>
            <li>Say "OK"</li>
            <li>Do it right away.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>These skills let people know that you have heard what they said.
          You are more likely to get your work done because you have followed
          the instructions. When you follow instructions, you are more likely to 
          receive a positive response for doing your work. parents will be happy
          to see you do what you are asked to do right after being told.
        </p>
        <p>We are continuing to work on being to school on time!! Delta South Bunnies
          are on time for school by:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Being in our classroom</li>
            <li>Sitting at our desk</li>
            <li>Ready to Learn.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>School starts at 8:20 and our PM Classes start at 11:45. It is our goal
          to have students in their seats and ready to learn by the time school begins.
        </p>
        <p>Breakfast is from 7:45-8:10. if your student eats breakfast at school, 
          please have them here before 8:10 so they will have time to eat breakfast 
          by the time school begins!
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for all you do as parents and partners in your child's education!!!

        <p>Students will be wearing their costumes all day because of the carnival.
          Please follow these guidelines to make it comfortable for your child to
          wear his/her costume all day. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>NO MASKS of any kind-- not even partial Zorro type ones.</li>
          <li>Avoid a lot of facial make-up -- it itches and gets uncomfortable 
            if they have to wear it all day.</li>
          <li>Please leave EXTRAS such as pitchforks, swords, wands, etc. at HOME. 
            They are not appropriate to haul around all day.</li>
          <li>NO GUNS -- real or pretend -- water or pellet -- It is against the 
            Safe Schools policy to bring these items on a school campus.</li>
          <li>PLEASE  have your child wear something they can use the restroom in.</li>
          <li>HATS may be worn to school but MAY NOT be worn during class time or at
            lunch. This includes princess hats, witches hats, baseball hats, and 
            anything else that sits on your head and caan obstruct the view of 
            someone behind you!</li>
          <li>If any part of the costume makes a noise, LEAVE IT HOME! You can 
            add it when they go trick or treating.</li>
          <li>A change of clothing may be brought to school for students to change 
            into if they get tired of wearing their costume.</li>
